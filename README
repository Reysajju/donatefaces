donatefaces

    by Joseph Turian

Extract faces from video clips; generate training data for pose-invariant face features.

Python OpenCV face detection code originally based upon code from Robert Martin “Marty” McGuire:
    http://creatingwithcode.com/howto/face-detection-in-static-images-with-python/

REQUIREMENTS:
    * sudo apt-get install python-opencv libcv-dev
        /usr/share/opencv/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
        is contained in libcv-dev so you actually need to install that
        too for the code to run
