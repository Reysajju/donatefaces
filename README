donatefaces

    by Joseph Turian

Extract faces from video clips; generate training data for pose-invariant face features.

REQUIREMENTS:
    * OpenCV (>=2?) with *old* style (Swig) Python bindings
        * If you are under Ubuntu, this is easy to install:
            sudo apt-get install python-opencv libcv-dev

            Note:
            /usr/share/opencv/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
            is contained in libcv-dev so you actually need to install
            that too for the code to run
        * If you are compiling the code from scratch, make sure you use option:
                -D BUILD_SWIG_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON
            when running 'cmake' to get the old style bindings.
        * Note: The new style Python bindings are incomplete, unfortunately:

CREDITS:
    * Python OpenCV face detection code originally based upon code from

DEPRECATED

    * pyffmpeg
        http://code.google.com/p/pyffmpeg/issues/detail?id=9#c5

    * PyMedia
        For converting a video into images. I use version 1.3.7.3.
            <http://securfox.wordpress.com/2009/05/15/pymedia-on-debian-lenny/>
            Edit the audio/acodec/acodec.c file and on line 31 insert the following :

            #define HAVE_LRINTF

            So you should have:

            #include <libavcodec/avcodec.h>
            #define HAVE_LRINTF
            #include “libavcodec/dsputil.h”
            #include “version.h”
        TODO: Just use OpenCV cvCaptureFromFile method? PyMedia is old
        and unsupported.

    * Video to image dumping is from PyMedia example code:
